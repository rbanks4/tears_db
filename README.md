# tears_db (Tears of the Kingdom Database Tool for Android) 
Currently coding a ver_0.01 that has the bare bones that can be added upon later.
This project uses MongoDB (free version) so the data I pull I limited -- most of it is local because I'm not paying for this to be full backend when most data won't ever change.

See <a href="https://github.com/rbanks4/tears_db/tree/version_0.01">Version 0.01</a> for latest

|Current progress is just an activity that loads a fragment from a list. |Update (7/5/23) Now we can search and sort based on certain params |
